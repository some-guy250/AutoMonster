## 🕹️ Setting Up an Emulator

To automate tasks in Monster Legends, you'll need to set up an emulator on your computer.

### Step 1: Choose, Download and Install the Emulator an Emulator

There are several emulators available for running Android apps on your computer. Some popular choices include:

- **BlueStacks**: One of the most popular Android emulators, known for its stability and performance.
- **NoxPlayer**: Another reliable emulator with a wide range of features.
- **LDPlayer**: Optimized for gaming, LDPlayer offers smooth gameplay and customization options.

Choose any emulator that has access to adb and can run Android apps on your computer.

### Step 2: Install Monster Legends

After setting up the emulator, it is recommended to install Monster Legends using an APK file and not from the Google
Play Store. APKPure is a good source for APK files since Google Play Store sometimes detects emulators and doesn't allow
you to download the game.

### Step 3: Configure Emulator Settings

To ensure the script run, configure the emulator settings as follows:

- **Resolution**: Set the resolution to 1280x720
- **DPI**: Set the DPI to 240
- **ADB Connection**: Enable ADB connection in the emulator settings to allow communication with the automation scripts.
