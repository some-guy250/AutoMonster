# NOTE: av and scrcpy-client have a version conflict:
# - scrcpy-client requires av<10.0.0,>=9.0.0
# - av 9.x fails to build on Python 3.10+ due to Cython errors
# - av 16.0.1 has pre-built wheels and is API-compatible with scrcpy-client
#
# Installation order:
# 1. Install av==16.0.1 first (pre-built binary)
# 2. Install scrcpy-client with --no-deps
# 3. Install remaining dependencies
# See install_dependencies.bat for automated installation
